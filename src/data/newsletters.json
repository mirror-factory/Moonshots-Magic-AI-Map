      "content": "East End Market, the beloved Audubon Park food hall that has anchored the neighborhood's culinary scene since 2013, has officially opened the doors on its expansion project. The new wing adds five vendor stalls, a shared commissary kitchen, and a rooftop cocktail bar with views of the surrounding oak canopy.\n\nAmong the new tenants are Masa Ramen, helmed by a former Kadence chef bringing handmade noodles to the space, and Dulce de Orlando, a Cuban-inspired bakery from a family with deep roots in the Azalea Park community. The rooftop bar, called Canopy, focuses on Florida-sourced spirits and citrus-forward cocktails.\n\nMarket founder John Rife described the expansion as a natural evolution of the original vision: a place where local food entrepreneurs can grow without the overhead of a standalone restaurant. Weekend hours now extend to 10 PM to accommodate the rooftop bar programming.",

      "content": "The Orlando metro area added 3,200 technology jobs in the final quarter of 2025, according to new data from the Orlando Economic Partnership. The gains were concentrated in artificial intelligence, simulation, and defense technology, sectors that have historically anchored the region's tech identity but are now attracting a new wave of venture-backed startups.\n\nLake Nona's growing innovation district accounted for nearly a third of the new positions, with companies like Luminar Technologies and several stealth-mode AI firms expanding their Orlando footprints. The University of Central Florida's AI and machine learning programs continue to feed the local talent pipeline, graduating over 600 students in related fields last year.\n\nIndustry leaders point to Orlando's relatively affordable cost of living, proximity to defense contractors, and the modeling-and-simulation expertise built over decades at Research Park as key advantages over more saturated tech hubs.",

Beyond the parks, sports tourism saw a notable boost from the 2025 Pro Bowl Games and several major esports events held at the Orange County Convention Center.\n\nVisit Orlando president Casandra Matej noted that the challenge ahead is managing growth sustainably, with infrastructure investments in transit, housing, and hospitality workforce development at the top of the agenda for 2026.",
