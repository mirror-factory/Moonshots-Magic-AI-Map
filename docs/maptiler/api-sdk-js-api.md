# SDK JS Reference

This reference documents every object and method available in the **MapTiler SDK JS**. The SDK uses WebGL in the browser to take advantage of hardware graphics acceleration provided by the user’s device.

## Objects and methods

Each section describes classes or objects as well as their **properties, parameters, methods**, and associated **events**. Many sections also include inline code examples and related resources.

## About MapTiler SDK

The SDK allows create interactive maps from vector tiles data (in PBF format) and raster tiles data. Take a look at [What are vector tiles and why you should care?](https://www.maptiler.com/news/2019/02/what-are-vector-tiles-and-why-you-should-care/)

It provides all the functions and data required to fuel a complete web mapping experience: vector tiles, satellite raster tiles, DEM with Terrain RGB, etc. Allows you to tailor the visual appearance of a map: what data to draw, the order to draw it, and how to lay out the data when drawing following the [GL style specification](https://docs.maptiler.com/gl-style-specification/).

Under the hood, this SDK is opinionated as it’s being fed by MapTiler services, but its MapLibre GL JS[1](https://docs.maptiler.com/sdk-js/api/#fn:1) (`v5.14.0`) core makes it 100% compatible with other sources. The MapTiler mapping platform provides a number of built-in [Map Styles](https://docs.maptiler.com/sdk-js/api/map-styles), that are integrated into the SDK. These styles use data from the [MapTiler tileset](https://docs.maptiler.com/schema/).

There is no need to load external plugins for the most basic things like adding common map controls or enabling 3D terrain every time you start a project. All this is built-in, loaded when needed, or exposed with simple functions.
